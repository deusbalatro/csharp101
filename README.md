Hi,

I uploaded the things I created during my C# and .NET learning process. In fact, it's not limited to those, but if you're new to C#, you can get familiar with its syntax and flow. All of these were kind of assignments in Microsoft's courses.

# What do we have?
- Iterations
- FizzBuzz Challenge
- Grade Calculators
- Simple Console Battle Game
- Simple Rock Paper Scissors Console Game
- Conditions, loops, etc.

I hope it will be beneficial for you.

Bye!
